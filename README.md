# FAQ
**Q:** How can I download the images so I can recode the website or
change some code etc?
**A:** Click this link () and download the ".rar" file.
When you do that, be sure to have downloaded all the HTML, CSS and JS
files.
After that, open tha "imgs.rar" file and drag the "imgs" folder
into the folder of the html files etc.
Do **NOT** change the name of the folder from "imgs" to anything else,
**unless** you know what you're doing and how to fix any issues that
will come up after it.
